The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

提姆·彼得斯的《Python之禅》
美丽胜于丑陋。
显式优于隐式。
简单胜于复杂。
复杂总比隐晦好
扁平比嵌套好。
稀疏胜于稠密。
可读性计数。
特殊情况不足以打破规则。
尽管实用性胜过纯粹性。
错误永远不应默默传递。
除非明确禁止。
面对模棱两可的问题，拒绝猜测。
应该有一种——最好只有一种——明显的方法来实现。
尽管这种方式一开始可能并不明显，除非你是荷兰人。
现在总比永远好。
尽管永远不会比现在更好。
如果实现很难解释，那是个坏主意。
如果实现很容易解释，这可能是一个好主意。
命名空间是一个非常好的主意——让我们做更多这样的事情吧！
